# Waste Classification

## General info
The project concerns waste classification to determine if it may be recycle or not. The dataset contains waste images recyclable and organic ones. In our approach we will use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model with data augumentation to achieve the best results.

The dataset comes from Kaggle and can be find [here](https://www.kaggle.com/techsash/waste-classification-data).

### Project includes:

* Waste classification with CNN model - **Waste_cnn.ipynb**
